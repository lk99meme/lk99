The material was first discovered and manufactured by a team of Sukbae Lee (이석배), Ji-Hoon Kim (김지훈), et al. from the Korea Institute of Science and Technology.The team claims it functions as a superconductor at ambient pressure and below 400K
If this superconductor is confirmed, a huge wave coming to the world
